# URL.LY

### Get it rolling

`npm start` the server in `./server`. Just a basic express server.
`react-native start` in root directory
Point `baseURL` in `config.js` to point the app at a different url if you don't use `http://localhost:3000` by default

##### Caveats
- I'm sure I'm stating the obvious to you all, but you would not be able to use this on a device pointed at localhost:3000 by default
- I'll list more here if they come to mind

##### Planned Items, but time caught me
1. Redux store (sad I didn't get to this)
2. A working redirect when clicking on a shortened URL
3. Half decent styling
4. More intuitive UX
5. More accessible backend (get/post remotely)
